## About Me

Hello! I am a 4th year PhD student in Computer Science in Washington University in St. Louis. I am a part of the [Stream-Based Supercomputing Lab](https://sbs.wustl.edu/) advised by Dr. Jeremy Buhler. 

I am currently working on the computational pipeline for the Advanced Particle Astrophysics Telescope (APT) and the Antarctic Demonstrator for the Advanced Particle Astrophysics Telescope ([ADAPT](https://adapt.physics.wustl.edu/)) for Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) localization. 

Broadly, I am interested in working with algorithms and deep learning applications from an architectural perspective (GPUs).

## Research Interests

Machine Learning Acceleration, Artificial Intelligence, Model Optimization, Pruning, Quantization, Simulation, High Performance Computing, Real-time Computing, Low-Power Design, Data Structure & Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing

## Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C/C++, Bash, CUDA, OpenMP
- **Tools:** PyTorch, Lightning, ONNX, sklearn, wandb, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Git, Docker, Linux
